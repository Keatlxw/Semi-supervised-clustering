# Semi-Supervised Clustering Awesome Repository

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This repository contains a list of resources related to semi-supervised clustering. Semi-supervised clustering is a type of clustering where some labels (or a partial set) are available, in addition to the data. The goal is to leverage these labels, along with the data, to perform better clustering. The problem is not well understood, and there are a variety of approaches to solve semi-supervised clustering.

Contributors and new resources are welcome. Please make a pull request or open an issue.

# What's Semi-Supervised Clusteringï¼Ÿ
Semi-supervised clustering refers to a type of clustering algorithm where the clustering process is partially guided by available labeled data in addition to unlabeled data. In semi-supervised clustering, the goal is to leverage the limited labeled data, along with the unlabeled data, to perform better clustering than what could be achieved by using only the unlabeled data.

In the context of semi-supervised clustering, the available labeled data may consist of a small but representative sample of the data set, or a partial set of the true cluster labels. The unlabeled data set, on the other.More details can be found in the survey paper.[Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020025523002840)

## Benchmark Datasets

Since semi-supervised clustering is primarily applied to graph-structured data, there are no â€˜non-graph datasetsâ€™ available for this purpose. Typically, semi-supervised learning algorithms are only used in graph data because only graph data can naturally define neighborhood relationships.

#### Quick Start

- Step1: Download all datasets from \[[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1thSxtAexbvOyjx-bJre8D4OyFKsBe1bK?usp=sharing) | [Nutstore](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DfzK1pwQwdaSChjI2aME)]. Optionally, download some of them from URLs in the tables (Google Drive)
- Step2: Unzip them to **./dataset/**
- Step3: Change the type and the name of the dataset in **main.py**
- Step4: Run the **main.py**

- **utils.py**
  1. **load_data**: load graph datasets 
  2. **preprocess_data**:  performs additional preprocessing on the data
  3. **generate_labels**: generates pseudolabels or predicted labels
  4. **train_model**:  trains the semi-supervised clustering model on the data
  5. **predict_clusters**: predicts the cluster assignments for the unlabeled data
  6. **evaluate_model**: evaluates the performance of the model on test data
  7. **plot_clusters**: visualizes the cluster assignments and/or centroids in a scatter plot, heatmap, or other graphical representation
  8. **save_model and load_model**:   computes various clustering performance metrics
  9. **compute_cluster_metrics**: evaluate the performance of clustering
  10. **normalize_data**: normalizes the data for better clustering performance
